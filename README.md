Simple django floppyform widgets that appends a character count to a text input which is determined by the `max_length` of that particular field.
HTML5 accepts `max_length` on __text input__ and __text area__ tags.

Code based on https://github.com/timmyomahony/django-charsleft-widget, updated to use floppyforms and HTML5.



### Requirements and Installation ###

Just use pip to install directly from github. Requires floppyforms.
